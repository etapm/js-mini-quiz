# js-mini-quiz
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to enhance my coding skills by building a fun and interactive Javascript Quiz in a game format. The aim was to make it easy and enjoyable for users to reinforce their understanding of Javascript while competing with others on the same device. By gamifying the studying process, the project addresses the problem of tedious and repetitive studying. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in making studying fun and interactive. Although there are areas for improvement, I am confident in my ability to continue developing this project in a direction that will benefit both users and the product. The unique aspect of this project is its ability to engage users and encourage them to improve their scores through reinforcing their Javascript knowledge, making it a mutually beneficial experience for all parties.
